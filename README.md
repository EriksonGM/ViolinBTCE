## Synopsis

This project aims to offer an API which is easy to use and ensure behavior by testing all of the code. 

This project is a fork of https://github.com/DmT021/BtceApi . It has been cleaned up and used some new techniques for implementation. Unit tests are now being written to ensure 100% of expected behavior.

## Code Example

I am still writing unit tests and for the lower level operation and the the API is still not usable. I'll be adding the sintaxes of use asap.

## Motivation

I decided to have a clean, easy to use API in order to create scripts to trade on the BTC-E market, so that I didn't need to worry about the API i was using. The old API offered by DmT021 is great, but did not make be comfortable to use it without eing sure it works as I expected.

## Installation

Add the projects to your solution and start using the sintaxes shown on "Code examples". You can also compile the project and reference it in your project (more comfortable).

## API Reference

I'll create an API Reference page as soon as it's finished and tested.

## Tests

Tests status: <img alt="Tests status" src="https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/u76hesrmw3rgywoy"/>

To run the tests, you can use NUnit GUI, for example. I use resharper to run it and dotcover to detect what is being covered or not.
